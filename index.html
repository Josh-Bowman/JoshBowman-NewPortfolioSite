                    <p>I'm a computer technician and aspiring software developer located in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
                    <p>I'm both a PC Technician, as well as a Web Developer, focusing on React.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <div>
            <!-- Past -->
            <p>Despite having majored in music, my career path has revolved around computers, diagnostics, and technical support. Before the quarantines, I was working part-time as a Student Technician for the Citrus College Tech department. While there, I learned a great deal about diagnostics, troubleshooting, networks, and protocols.</p>
            <!-- Present -->
            <p>Presently, I still receive work as a contracted computer technician. Here, I can apply my diagnostic skills while still learning new ways to fix things. Occasionally, I receive calls to visit customers in their homes to set-up or upgrade their existing systems, including not just their computers, but their home networks as well. Because of my 3+ years in this field, I've acquired a keen eye for detail and troubleshooting, when it comes to diagnosing issues and debugging.<p>
            <!-- Future -->
            <p>Through <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I have an opportunity to acquire new skills in software engineering that is still related to my present talents. Even after learning full-stack development, I'm exited to expand my skill set and gain mastery over loosely or seemingly unrelated topics, so that I may have the skills to combine them for even greater projects!</p>
            <!-- Working with others -->
            <p>I'm always looking forward to working with people of other trades and talents, as there is always a way to learn from them, and apply their knowledge to my own endeavors.</p>
            </div>
        <h3>Services</h3>    
            <div>
            <p> I can provide services in diagnostics, debugging, and am eager to begin working on apps using React!</p>
            <p> I can also make websites and style them according to your preferences, and include forms for user submissions as well.</p>

        <p>Some hobbies that I really enjoy in my downtime are:</p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Exploring Raspberry-Pi projects</li>
                <li>Building and repairing PCs (more of a side-hustle)</li>
                <li>Playing instruments, such as piano or ukulele</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
					<p>This is my most recent project, still in the works. It's a timer based off of the "Pomodoro Technique", first going off after 25 minutes of production, and then again after a 5-minute break. Possible updates include allowing the user to assign their own duration for work and break times. Once it's fully functioning, I will include an image and link!</p>
                    <p>I am building this project as part of my curriculum at Thinkful, so gain and show my proficiency with React.</p>
                    <p>This application was built using React, Javascript, HTML, and stylized with CSS.</p>

          <h3>Decoder Ring</h3>
					<p>This project helped me learn the basics of Javascript, and even a little about how ASCII works. This project includes a Caesar Shift, a Polybius Square, and Substitution Cipher. I will be deploying this shortly.</p>
                    <p>This project uses the stack, both front-end and back-end.</p>
                    <p>This project was made as a means of gaining proficiency in Javascript. I worked with a small group of people and we all learned a lot about Javascript from each other!</p>
